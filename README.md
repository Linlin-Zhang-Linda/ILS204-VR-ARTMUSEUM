**PS.** I also try to make the animated "Post-Vitruvian Man,", but it just looks too horrible, so I consider not including it in the museum. And for the generative AI (talkative model) part, I am sorry that I spent much effort on the building and polishing of the Art Museum itself and finding the appropriate artwork. I am still struggling with the AI for Unity, since there are not many clear documents to follow, so I apologize that I tend to update that later, if possible.Â 
For this project, I aim to concentrate more on the things mentioioned in the proposal feedback.

My main point is that even though the transformation from Renaissance humanism to posthumanism represents a continuum of expanding and refining human capacities, it also raises very critical and complex ethical challenges. In which case, misusing technology might result in losing human being's nature value and ethics!
